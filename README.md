In this project, our team has created a database to keep track of the Covid-19 vaccine
distribution and treatment in Finland. It tracks different vaccine types, transportation of
vaccine batches, treatment plans, as well as patient information. In this document, we
present the details of the project. The Python and the SQL files used to build this database
and to run sample queries are included in the zip package together with this document
itself. The files can be run by simply compiling the Python files or executing SQL queries.
